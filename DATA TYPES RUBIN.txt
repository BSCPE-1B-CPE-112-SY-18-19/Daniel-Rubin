		DIFFERENT DATA TYPES IN C++

Data Types in C++

Data types in C++ are categorised in three groups: 
     *Built-in, 
     *User-defined, and 
     *Derived.

~Built in data types
*char: For characters. Size 1 byte.
    char ch = 'A';

*int: For integers. Size 2 bytes.
    int num = 100;

*float: For single precision floating point. Size 4 bytes.
    float num = 123.78987;

*double: For double precision floating point. Size 8 bytes.
    double num = 10098.98899;

*bool: For booleans, true or false.
    bool b = true;

*wchar_t: Wide Character. This should be avoided because its size is implementation defined and not reliable.

~User-defined data types
   We have three types of user-defined data types in C++
    1. struct
    2. union
    3. enum

  ~Derived data types in C++
      We have three types of derived-defined data types in C++
        1. Array
        2. Function
        3. Pointer
